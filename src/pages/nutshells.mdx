## : wait, who are you?

hi! i'm [hex4](https://hex4.xyz). i'm a middle schooler, community member at Hack Club and the maintainer of README. coding & computers have changed my life for the better, and i'm so grateful that I now get to share that joy with others through Hack Club.

aside from coding, I snowboard, rock climb, design in Figma, play D&D, draw terrible pixel art, and a whole lot of nerd stuff in general. if you need help with anything, [dm me on Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U071JHBEJ7R)!

README is an open source project, and so many people have contributed to it over time. Thank you to:

## : component: clubs

<Emoji name="hackclub-party"/> Hack Clubs are student-led after-school coding clubs where teens are building the class they wish they could take. Hack Clubs usually meet once a week after school, and members participate in workshops, build awesome technical projects, and demo them to their peers and the world 🌎

Club leaders get access to a huge library of free [workshops](https://workshops.hackclub.com) and [jams](https://jams.hackclub.com) to help their members learn new skills, as well as free stickers & posters, a nonprofit fund via [HCB](https://hcb.hackclub.com) to help fundraise, and a supportive community of other club leaders around the world.

## : component: slack

<Emoji name="slackbot_thonk"/> The Hack Club Slack is a **huge** online community (~20k active members) of teen hackers, builders, coders, writers, artists, filmmakers, and more. It's the perfect place to ask questions, get help with your projects, find collaborators, share your work, and meet other awesome people from around the world. Across hundreds of active channels, you'll find awesome people chatting about everything from the 67 meme to web development, game jams, and music production.

Join at [hackclub.com/slack](https://hackclub.com/slack).

## : component: ysws

<Emoji name="shipitparrot" /> At Hack Club, we believe the best way to learn is to build & ship real projects - that's why we run a huge variety of "You Ship, We Ship" (YSWS) programs & events throughout the year. Most of these programs follow a similar format: you build something awesome, ship it to the world, and we'll physically ship you some cool stuff to help you keep building! Previous YSWS programs have granted domain credits, drawing robots, microcontrollers, stickers, t-shirts, and more.

Check out the current YSWS programs at [ysws.hackclub.com](https://ysws.hackclub.com). An awesome starter YSWS is [Boba Drops](https://boba.hackclub.com) - build your first website and get $5 to spend on boba!

## : component: programs

<Emoji name="summer25"/> Throughout the year, Hack Club HQ runs multiple large-scale virtual events to help you learn new skills & get awesome stuff to help you build your projects. We usually run a summer and winter "general YSWS" - where you can build anything you want, ship it to get a virtual currency, and spend that currency on things like laptops, hosting credits, swag, 3D printers, and more. Past examples include [Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com) (summer 2025), and [High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com) (winter 2024).

We've also run more specialized events like [Highway](https://highway.hackclub.com) (build hardware projects, get them funded), [Milkyway](https://milkyway.hackclub.com) (code games, get prizes), and [Siege](https://siege.hackclub.com) (ship something every week for 10 weeks, get a Framework laptop).

## : component: hq events

<Emoji name="hackers-assemble" /> Hack Club runs multiple IRL events throughout the year. Over time we've [hosted 150 teens for a hardware hackathon at GitHub HQ](https://undercity.hackclub.com), [built a hacker cafe in Shanghai](https://juice.hackclub.com), [turned a Vermont campground into a hacker oasis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1s5HqSqKi0), and so, so much more. These adventures are special - you'll build amazing technical projects while making lifelong friends in amazing places around the world.

Hack Club events are usually merit-based, meaning that the only condition to attend is building awesome projects and submitting them to the program! Your experience will be fully funded, including lodging, food, local transit, etc. Flight stipends (possibly need-based ones as well) are often available too.

## component: satellites

<Emoji name="daydream"/> A few times a year, Hack Clubbers across the world come together to host "satellite hackathon" events - hundreds of local, teen-organized, in-person hackathons happening simultaneously worldwide. These events are a great way to meet other local hackers, build cool projects, and have fun with friends! Past examples include [Daydream](https://daydream.hackclub.com) (simultaneous game jams in 100+ cities), and [Scrapyard](https://scrapyard.hackclub.com) (a hackathon for stupid ideas, in 50+ cities). Community members also frequently organize their own local hackathons - check out [hackathons.hackclub.com](https://hackathons.hackclub.com) to find one near you!

Satellite hackathon organizers get access to funding, swag, mentorship from Hack Club HQ, and a supportive community of other teen organizers around the world.

## : wait, what's a "hacker?"

good question! contrary to popular belief, a "hacker" isn't someone who breaks into computer systems or does anything illegal. a hacker is simply someone who solves problems in creative ways - usually with code. hackers build, iterate, break, and ship things that make the world better. if you're someone who likes to tinker, create, and learn new things, then congratulations: you're a hacker!
