## Thank you to Hex-4 for the <a href="https://github.com/Hex-4/readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original code</a>!

Hey! You've stumbled across README, a fun, concise guide to Hack Club, our community, and programming in general. We're glad to have you!

Hack Club is a global community of teen artists, writers, coders, makers, designers, and hackers building the agency, the network, & the technical talent to think big & do big things in the world. We run hundreds of clubs in schools around the world, provide grants, funding, & resources to help young people build projects that matter to them, and host events & workshops to help our community learn new skills. Hack Clubbers also go on incredible adventures together - from coding on a train across Canada to building a pop-up arcade in Tokyo!

I joined Hack Club in May of 2024, and while it has been the most transformative experience of my life, I still remember how overwhelming it felt at first.
What's a YSWS? Why is everyone better at coding than me? Wait, what's HCB? Is this illegal? Why are there so many channels on Slack?? Why is everyone using the <Emoji name="pf"/> emoji??

*(☝ this is an "expandable explanation!" instead of linking to a page that breaks your reading flow, just click it to expand the whole thing inline)*

This README is the guide I wish I had when I first joined Hack Club. It covers everything from the culture & values of Hack Club, to how to get involved in our community, to the technical skills you'll need to build your own projects. Unlike *boring 🙄* documentation or handbooks, this site is designed to be fun, concise, and approachable for everyone <Emoji name="yay" />

## An Attempt at an Introduction

Maybe the reason no one has a good summary of Hack Club is because Hack Club is actually *a lot of different things operating under one org.* Here, we have:
